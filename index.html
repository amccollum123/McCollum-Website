  <h2>My Favorite Edtech Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nearpod</strong> - I like the interactive elements in Nearpod.  It makes it easy for teachers and students to share resources, answer questions, complete quizzes, investigate 3D objects, explore VR videos, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Goosechase</strong> - This tool allows you to create fun scavenger hunts.  Users complete challenges, submitting answers as texts, photos, or video.  I love using it with students and staff. </li>  
            <li><strong>Flipgrid</strong> - Flipgrid is a quick way for students to share thier video responses.   With a very simple interface the students intuitively know how to use it.  They love being able to view each others' responses as well as leave video feedback for each other.</li>
