            <h2>A Short Bio</h2>
                <p>
                     I am an instructional technology facilitator and electives teacher at an elementary Magnet school in Raleigh. I am excited to soon be completing the Masters of Learning Design and Technology. 
                </p>

        <h2>My Favorite Edtech Tools</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://nearpod.com/"><strong>Nearpod</strong></a> - I like the interactive elements in Nearpod.  It makes it easy for teachers and students to share resources, answer questions, complete quizzes, investigate 3D objects, explore VR videos, and more.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.goosechase.com/"><strong>Goosechase</strong></a> - This tool allows you to create fun scavenger hunts.  Users complete challenges, submitting answers as texts, photos, or video.  I love using it with students and staff. </li>  
                  <li><a href="https://info.flipgrid.com/"><strong>Flipgrid</strong></a> - Flipgrid is a quick way for students to share thier video responses.   With a very simple interface the students intuitively know how to use it.  They love being able to view each others' responses as well as leave video feedback for each other.</li> 
                </ul>
